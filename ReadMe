### System Architecture Overview:

#### 1. **Cloud Infrastructure**
- **Cloud Provider:** AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- **Services Used:**
  - **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** To host and run the web servers and backend services.
  - **RDS (Relational Database Service):** For managing databases in a scalable manner.
  - **Elastic Load Balancing:** To distribute incoming application traffic across multiple EC2 instances, ensuring durability and fault tolerance.
  - **S3 (Simple Storage Service):** For storing logs, backups, and other static files.
  - **CloudFront:** As a CDN to distribute content to end-users with low latency.
  - **IAM (Identity and Access Management):** To manage access to AWS services securely.
  - **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** To create a secured private network to deploy AWS resources.

#### 2. **Back-End Architecture**
- **Technology Stack:**
  - **Node.js:** For handling business logic due to its non-blocking I/O and event-driven nature, ideal for network-heavy tasks.
  - **Express.js:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **APIs:**
  - **RESTful API:** To facilitate communication between the front-end and back-end.
  - **WebSockets:** For real-time data transfer, especially useful in network scanning and protocol simulation.
- **Database:**
  - **PostgreSQL (AWS RDS):** Chosen for its reliability and feature set, ideal for complex queries and data integrity.
- **Security Features:**
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For secure transmission of information as an authentication token.
  - **HTTPS:** Ensured by default for all communications between the clients and the server.
  - **Network Security Groups:** To control inbound and outbound traffic to resources.

#### 3. **Front-End Architecture**
- **Technology Stack:**
  - **React.js:** A powerful library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications where dynamic content is a must.
  - **Redux:** For managing application state.
  - **Material-UI:** For designing a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
- **Features:**
  - **Interactive Dashboard:** For displaying real-time data, logs, and analysis results.
  - **User Authentication Views:** Login, registration, and user profile management.
  - **Protocol Configuration and Management:** UI components that allow users to configure settings for different protocols.

#### 4. **Development and Deployment**
- **Version Control:**
  - **Git:** With repositories hosted on GitHub.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment:**
  - **Jenkins/AWS CodePipeline:** For automating the testing and deployment of the application code from GitHub to AWS.
- **Containerization:**
  - **Docker:** To containerize the application, ensuring consistency across multiple development and production environments.
- **Monitoring and Logging:**
  - **AWS CloudWatch:** To monitor applications and services, capturing logs, metrics, and events.

#### 5. **Compliance and Security**
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) by implementing proper data handling and user consent management.
- Regular security audits and updates to address any vulnerabilities in the application.

This architecture provides a solid foundation for a scalable, secure, and efficient web-based system that simulates network protocols and performs network scanning. It balances real-time data handling with strong security measures, ensuring the system's reliability and user trust
