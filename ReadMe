#Cloud-Based Web App for Protocol Simulation and Network Scanning

##Overview

This repository outlines the system architecture for a cloud-based web application designed to simulate network protocols such as Modbus TCP/IP, BACnet IP, and MSTP, and to provide robust network scanning capabilities. The architecture is built to be robust, scalable, and secure, leveraging various services from AWS (Amazon Web Services). The details of the front-end, back-end, and cloud infrastructure components are covered comprehensively in this README.

##System Architecture Overview

###1. **Cloud Infrastructure**

####Cloud Provider
**AWS (Amazon Web Services)**

####Services Used
- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Hosts and runs the web servers and backend services.
- **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Manages databases efficiently and at scale.
- **Elastic Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure durability and fault tolerance.
- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Stores logs, backups, and other static files.
- **CloudFront**: Serves as a CDN to distribute content to end-users with reduced latency.
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Manages secure access to AWS services.
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Provides a secure private network for deploying AWS resources.

###2. **Back-End Architecture**

####Technology Stack
- **Node.js**: Handles business logic, suited for network-heavy tasks due to its non-blocking I/O and event-driven capabilities.
- **Express.js**: A flexible web application framework that offers a robust set of features for web and mobile apps.

####APIs
- **RESTful API**: Facilitates communication between the front-end and back-end.
- **WebSockets**: Enables real-time data transfer, critical for network scanning and protocol simulation.

####Database
- **PostgreSQL (AWS RDS)**: Chosen for its reliability, ideal for complex queries and ensuring data integrity.

####Security Features
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Secures transmission of information as authentication tokens.
- **HTTPS**: Ensures all communications between the clients and the server are secure.
- **Network Security Groups**: Controls inbound and outbound traffic to resources.

###3.**Front-End Architecture**

####Technology Stack
- **React.js**: Builds dynamic user interfaces, particularly useful for single-page applications.
- **Redux**: Manages application state.
- **Material-UI**: Designs responsive and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces.

####Features
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Displays real-time data, logs, and analysis results.
- **User Authentication Views**: Includes login, registration, and user profile management.
- **Protocol Configuration and Management**: Provides UI components for configuring settings for different protocols.

###4. **Development and Deployment**

####Version Control
- **Git**: Repositories hosted on GitHub.

#### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
- **Jenkins/AWS CodePipeline**: Automates testing and deployment of application code from GitHub to AWS.

####Containerization
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application, ensuring consistency across development and production environments.

####Monitoring and Logging
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitors applications and services, capturing logs, metrics, and events.

###5.**Compliance and Security**

- Ensures compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA through proper data handling and user consent management.
- Regular security audits and updates are conducted to address vulnerabilities in the application.

##Conclusion

The designed architecture provides a solid foundation for a scalable, secure, and efficient web-based system that simulates network protocols and performs network scanning. It balances real-time data handling with robust security measures, ensuring system reliability and user trust.
